# funcs.py

This is the python file containing the functions, imports and some paths necessary for the analysis in the paper.

# analysis.ipynb
This is the notebook containing the necessary scripts to reproduce the resulting figures in the paper.

## Analysis Sections

1. Full Radiation Scans
    1. Crystal / vesicle pi prepeak ratio comparison
    2. Radiaiton damage and tilting effect on absrption spectra
    3. Sample crystal and vesicle absorption wave graphs
    4. Peak width comparison between crystals and vesicles
2. Minimal Radiation Scans
    1. More tilting effects, more dense degrees
    2. Minimal radiation - showing that the chosen scans do not damage the results
    3. Radiation damage, continuing the previous analysis with more data.
    

## Requirements

Besides the requirements in the requirements.txt file, another requirement is access to the data itself. without this, the analysis cannot run. The code itself is built fitting to the directory structure the data is currently in. if it is changed/copied/moved, this might need to be updated.
